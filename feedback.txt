Hello Team,

Good job with your simulation. All operations on the network are well exposed throught rest endpoints. 
Could have added a simulated load with user requests based on the network size.

Your grades are updated on blackboard. (You will access them when they are released)

Regards,
Mohammed Siddiq.
